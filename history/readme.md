# Introduction
In this Article, we'll look at how modern fronend grew to provide this level of sophistication.
In late 1991, the first HTML specification was made public by Tim Berners-Lee.
In October 1994, CSS was proposed  Håkon Wium Lie.
In 1995, a new browser scriptiong language called Mocha was created by Brendan Erich.
In 1996, HTML4.0 was published which was the first specification to support CSS.

## CSS Framework
1. Supporting mutiple browsers was a nightware cause various CSS hacks were created to fix various problems with specific browsers. I think the most terrible thing is testing in many browsers while developing a web page, it always takes much time.
2. CSS2.1 became a Proposed Recomendation in April 2011, it took about 13 years to get there.
3. As for CSS3, the entire level 2.1 specification was broken down into modules. Each module is now developed independently.
4. CSS frameworks came up.

## Javascript Framework
1. Developers had to put a bit of extra effort to deal the browser compatibility.
2. jQuery is realeased in August 2006 that take developers out of dealing the browser compatibility. However, it lacked facilities for handling data consistenty across shared views. We need events to catch the data, and DOM operations to write data.
3. AJAX technology existed as early as 1996. Google implemented a standardized version of AJAX technology which has existed as early as 1996 on their Gmail and Google Maps products. And jQuery began adding support for AJAX.
4. In 2012, as frameworks and libraries increased, Twitter lanched Bower to manage frontend dependencies.
5. In 2014, npm was created.
6. In October 2010, AngularJS come into the market.
7. In May 2013, Ract was introduced.
8. In 2015, the Redux library was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clarke.
9. In February 2014, Vue.js was initially released in February 2014.

## Current Frontend
1. MVVM: Bind DOM width javascript variables.
