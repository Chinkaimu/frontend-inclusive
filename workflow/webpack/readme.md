# Introduction

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a `static module bundler` for modern JavaScript applications.  When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.

# Why and when should I use webpack ?
(I had a hard time grasping why I would use Webpack, but, I didn't know why. 
Finally I got it, the most serious problem is that I even had not generated the question while there are many vague ideas in my thinking. Therefore, reading the ducument in official website again and again helped me nothing.
The second problem is that my ideas are reasonable, but, I hadn't think further. Then I was blocked. I should implement my idea, and than I will konw why.)
Split many codes into modules for better organized and cooperation, after developed, bundle all up into a single file,. The dependencies are dealt by the modules, or we have to manage them with redundant programming. Here is the answer [Why would I use a Webpack?](http://tinselcity.net/whys/packers). I analyze the block reason is my tunnel view just in small files.
