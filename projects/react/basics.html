        <h3>1. JSX and UI</h3>
        <h4>conception</h4>
        <p>It's JavaScript object, describing HTML structure. We can write HTML sturcture code in js, React will help transform to JavaScript Object.</p>
        <h4>How is that JSX transformed into page.</h4>

        <h3>2. render</h3>
        <p>(1). A React module should at least implement render function, which return one JSX element.</p>
        <p>(2). Expression should wrapped width {} in JSX.</p>
        <p>(3). Expression in JSX can include ternary operator.</p>
        <p>(4). Element can be expressed by variables in JSX.</p>

        <br/>
        <h3>3. component tree</h3>

        <br/>
        <h3>4. events</h3>
        <p>React has implemented events, such as onClick, onKeyDown and so on. They can only affect normal html tags.</p>
        <h4>event object</h4>
        <p>(1). React event object is implemented by React.js in which the browser compatibility has been done, based in browser event object.</p>
        <p>(2). !!!"this" in event function is null, if you don't bind this to the function. Because React.js call the function delivered but not through object. </p>
        
        <br/>
        <h3>5. State and setState</h3>
        <p>(1). Change the state, and the component will be rerendered.</p>
        <p>(2). !!!When we call setState, the states can't be updated immediately, React.js cache the state in a queue((TODO: Is it the event queue ?)) and update the states later. If you want use the last state, function 
            'setState' provide the usage to pase a function with the param previous state value.
        </p>
        <p>(3). They will be combined if one event message has called "setState" manay times.</p>

        <br/>
        <h3>6. props</h3>
        <p>(1). Params in tag will be transformed props.</p>
        <p>(2). "defaultProps" is component's static property.</p>
        <p>(3). Props is read only property in component.</p>

        <br/>
        <h3>7. Lists and Keys</h3>
        <p>(1). React.js can render every elements in an array.</p>
        <p>(2). !!Keys in array elements is important. Check the <a href="//reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html">reason</a>, diff algorithm compare the component with same id, if there are no change, elements only need to move 
            or do nothing other than delete DOM and create DOM.</p>

        <br/>
        <h3>8. Life cycle</h3>
        <p>(1). mount lifecycle: constructor() => componentWillMount() => render() => insert DOM to page => componentDidMount() => componentWillUnmount</p>
        <p>(2). update lifecycle: willReceiveProps()/setState() => shouldComponentUpdate() => componentWillUpdate() => render() =>componentDidUpdate()</p>

        <br/>
        <h3>9. ref</h3>
        <p>Property 'ref' is a function that's param is the DOM node. Developers can parse the DOM node to "this", and call it after node mounted.</p>

        <br/>
        <h3>10. children</h3>
        <p>All the components inserted in the component A could be got by 'props.children' in A.</p>

        <br/>
        <h3>11. dangerouslySetInnerHTML and style
        <p>(1). The function of property 'dangerouslySetInnerHTML' equals to 'innerHTML'.HTML can analysed by browsers. The value is object width property "__html".</p>
        <p>(2). The 'style' property is object, too.</p>

        <br/>
        <h3>!!!12. When should a module be a indedependent component ?? </h3>
        <p>I leant from the comment-app that one comment should be a independent component, because the create time need update by state.</p>
        <p>I observe that repeating module should be a component for its expansibility. We maybe need add state in later. However, we don't want to parse props to 
            many layers, which can't be ignored.
        </p>

        <br/>
        <h3>Higher-Order Components</h3>
        <p>(1). To share codes between components, abstract some same logic function and pass datas by property "props".</p>
        <p>(2). Why don't we use inheriting?? We need pereserve the base function ability such as React lifycycle, if we overwrite it, we need complete again.</p>   

        <br/>
        <h3>React.js context</h3>
        <p>(1). Context setted by function "createContext" can be share by subcomponents.</p>
        <p>(2). Context shared between components is convenient. However, context value could be modifyed in every component, it will be unexpectable.</p>
